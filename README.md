# mean-and-stdev
A simple mean and stdev calculator I created in Python for to automate calculations for one of my physics labs. Enjoy!
It utilizes the sigfig library (link is here: [[httpsypi.org/project/sigfig/](https://pypi.org/project/sigfig/)](https://pypi.org/project/sigfig/)) for significant figures, and I used the shutup library made by polvoazul ([polvoazul](https://github.com/polvoazul/shutup)) because the warnings got annoying.
