# mean-and-stdev
A simple mean and stdev calculator I created in Python for to automate calculations for one of my physics labs. Enjoy!
It utilizes the sigfig library (link is here: (https://pypi.org/project/sigfig/) for significant figures, and I used the shutup library made by polvoazul (https://github.com/polvoazul/shutup) because some of the warnings got really annoying at some point.
